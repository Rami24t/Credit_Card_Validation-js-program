# Credit Card Validation

You're starting your own credit card business. You need to come up with a new way to validate credit cards with a simple function called  `validateCreditCard`  that returns  `true`  or  `false`.

Here are the rules for a valid number:

-   Number must be 16 digits, all of them must be numbers
-   You must have at least two different digits represented (all of the digits cannot be the same)
-   The final digit must be even
-   The sum of all the digits must be greater than 16

The following credit card numbers are valid:

-   `9999777788880000`
-   `6666666666661666`

The following credit card numbers are invalid:

-   `a92332119c011112`  _invalid characters_
-   `4444444444444444`  _only one type of number_
-   `1111111111111110`  _sum less than 16_
-   `6666666666666661`  _odd final number_


**Bonus #1:**  A valid credit card number may also contain dashes, to make a card number easier to read. For example, the following credit card numbers are now also valid:

-   `9999-7777-8888-0000`
-   `6666-6666-6666-1666`

Update your program to allow such numbers. (Hint: Remove the dashes from the input string before checking if the input credit card number is valid.)

**Bonus #2:**  Return an object indicating whether the credit card is valid, and if not, what the error is  
`{ valid: true, number: '9923-3211-9c01-1112' }`  
`{ valid: false, number: '9923-3211-9c01-1112', error: ‘wrong_length’ }`

**Bonus #3:**  Make your credit card scheme even more advanced! What are the rules, and what are some numbers that pass or fail? Ideas: check expiration date! Check out the  [Luhn Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)  for inspiration.
